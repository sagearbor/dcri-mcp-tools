Agent Instructions & Directives
This document outlines the core instructions and operating procedures for all AI agents working on the dcri-mcp-tools project.

Primary Directive: Update the Checklist
This is your most important task.

After you successfully complete any development task (such as creating a file, implementing a function, or writing a test), your final action must be to:

Open the CHECKLIST.md file.

Find the specific item or sub-item you just completed.

Mark the checkbox as complete by changing [ ] to [x].

This ensures the project status is always accurate and provides a clear record of what has been accomplished.

Example:
If you have just finished creating the server.py file, you will find the corresponding line in CHECKLIST.md and update it:

Before:
- [ ] 2. Core Server (server.py): Implement the Flask server...

After:
- [x] 2. Core Server (server.py): Implement the Flask server...

General Instructions
Follow the Checklist: Use CHECKLIST.md as your guide for all development tasks. Do not work on tasks out of the specified order unless instructed.

Ask for Clarification: If a task in the checklist is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details before proceeding.

One Task at a Time: Focus on completing one checklist item at a time to ensure high-quality, testable code.

Refer to Existing Files: Use the context from existing project files (README.md, .env.example, etc.) to inform your work.
